# Defines a list of WPS-1 processes references from remote service provider to register under Weaver at startup.
# Can also refer to any other remote WPS using providers.

# Details:
#   - if only the WPS-1 URL endpoint is provided, all processes found by `GetCapabilities` will be added
#   - if query `identifier=<process-id>` is provided in the URL, only matched process will be added.
#   - alternatively, a filtered list of processes to register can be specified with `id` under a given URL reference
#   - if `name` is not provided, a "clean" (slug) variation of the hostname will be used as service base name
#   - all processes are deployed using identifier `<service-name>_<process-id>`, with name resolved from above
#   - processes registered this way are static and local, in the sense that they will only save a snapshot of
#     the remote service at startup time (see 'providers' alternative).
# Result:
#   - for each process, `DescribeProcess` request will indicate how to generate and register an equivalent WPS-REST
#   - each process name will combine the service `name` and process `identifier` to reduce chances of conflicts
processes:
  # will deploy all processes returned by the default `GetCapabilities` operation (missing query parameters are added)
  # all deployed processes will be prefixed by `service-endpoint_`
  - https://service-endpoint/wps
  # same a previous, but with explicit query parameters specified
  - https://service-endpoint/wps?service=wps&request=GetCapabilities
  # will deploy only this specific process if ID matches an existing process
  # resulting name would be `another-endpoint_some-process`
  - https://another-endpoint/wps?service=wps&request=describeprocess&identifier=some-process
  # more verbose `name` to use instead of the default `named-endpoint` that would be resolved from the hostname
  - url: https://named-endpoint/wps
    name: named-endpoint-with-a-twist
    # directly set visibility to make process publicly available
    # otherwise it is private by default and cannot be listed nor executed until visibility is updated
    visible: true
  # explicit list of processes to deploy from all retrieved from `GetCapabilities` response
  # this is essentially equivalent to two `DescribeProcess` URL with specific `identifier` query parameter
  # (this variant saves some request operations and is easier to read)
  - url: https://named-processes/wps
    id:
      - process-1
      - process-2

# When using providers, only the remote service definition (name and remote URL endpoint) are stored.
# WPS processes under that service will be fetched each time they are requested, making responses dynamic to the
# referenced service offering response, but prone to unpredictable requests failure if the service becomes unavailable.
providers:
  # Without an explicit name, the service will be registered using an appropriate name from the URL reference
  - https://remote-service/wps
  # otherwise, the service is registered as is
  - url: https://other-service/wps
    name: OverrideName
    # visibility dictates accessibility of every underlying process (all or nothing)
    visible: true
