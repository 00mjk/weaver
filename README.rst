Introduction
============

Twitcher is a security proxy for Web Processing Services (WPS). The execution of a WPS process is blocked by the proxy. The proxy service provides access tokens (uuid) which needs to be used to run a WPS process. The access tokens are valid only for a short period of time.

Twitcher is a prototype implemented in Python with the Pyramid web framework.

Twitcher comes in two flavours:

* *A security proxy for Web Processing Services implemented in Python*
* *A security proxy for PyWPS with WSGI application layers*

Twitcher may become a candidate for the `GeoPython <http://geopython.github.io/>`_ project. 

Twitcher is part of the `Birdhouse <http://bird-house.github.io>`_ project.
